\plush{\pptChapter[Turing]{Who Are Abstract Machines?}}

\pptSection{Definition}

An \emph{abstract machine} is a theoretical \emph{model} of computation.

Similar to a function, a machine receives \emph{inputs} and produces \emph{outputs} based on predefined \emph{rules}.

Abstract machines are ``machines'' because they allow \emph{step-by-step} execution of programmes. (really?)

They are ``abstract'' because they ignore many aspects of actual (hardware) machines.

An abstract machine is an \emph{intermediate language} with a small-step operational semantics.

\pptSection{Purpose}

``The implementation of a programming language consists of two
stages. The implementation of the compiler and the implementation of the abstract (virtual?) machine.
This is a typical divide-and-conquer approach.
From a pedagogical point of view, this simplifies the presentation and
teaching of the principles of programming language implementations.
From a software engineering point of view, the introduction of layers of
abstraction increases maintainability and portability.'' (\href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X99000886}{1999})

\pptSection{Virtual Machines}

An abstract machine implemented in software is termed a \emph{virtual machine},
and one implemented in hardware is called simply a ``machine.''

JVM (for Java) and CLR (for .NET) are among most notable examples of virtual machines.

\pptSection{LLVM}

LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) is a standard de-facto.

\plush{\pptChapter[Turing]{Turing Machine}}

Turing Machine was the first (1936) ... but not the simplest.

\pptPic{0.7}{turing.png}

For example, Emil Post's Machine is simpler.

\plush{\pptChapter[SECD]{SECD Machine(s)}}

There are SECD (\textbf{s}tack, \textbf{e}nvironment, \textbf{c}ontrol, \textbf{d}ump),
CESK, CEK, CS, and maybe other abstract machines.

I like the CRM (\textbf{c}ontrol, \textbf{r}esults, \textbf{m}emory) machine explained by
\href{https://software-lab.org/people/Michael_Pradel.html}{Michael Pradel} in
\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRfb2zDk_qs}{his YouTube course} about program analysis:
$\langle c, r, m\rangle$.

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\langle \texttt{x} \mathrel{\texttt{:=}} 2 \times 3, \texttt{nil}, \{\} \rangle
  & \longrightarrow \langle \texttt{x} \mathrel{\circ} 2 \times 3 \mathrel{\circ} \mathrel{\texttt{:=}}, \texttt{nil}, \{ \}\rangle \\
  & \longrightarrow \langle 2 \times 3 \mathrel{\circ} \mathrel{\texttt{:=}}, \texttt{x} \mathrel{\circ} \texttt{nil}, \{ \}\rangle \\
  & \longrightarrow \langle \mathrel{\texttt{:=}}, \texttt{x} \mathrel{\circ} \texttt{6} \mathrel{\circ} \texttt{nil}, \{ \}\rangle \\
  & \longrightarrow \langle \texttt{nil}, \texttt{nil}, \{ \texttt{x} \mapsto 6 \}\rangle \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

\plush{\pptChapter{Semantic}}

This is our programming language that helps us draw on a canvas:

\begin{multicols}{2}
{\ttfamily
L 10, 20, 15, 23; \\
C 13, 13, 35; \\
L 5, 28, 15, 12;}

Its semantic may be explained by the abstract machine with the following instruction set, which semantic is \textbf{obvious} to a reader:
\par\columnbreak\par
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3,line width=4pt]
\path[draw] (1, 2) -- (1.5, 2.3);
\path[draw] (.5, 2.8) -- (1.5, 1.2);
\node[circle,minimum height=3.5cm,draw] at (1.3, 1.3) {};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{multicols}

{\ttfamily MOVE x, y; DRAW; \\
LOOP; IF t THEN BREAK; IF t THEN CONTINUE; END LOOP; \\
x > y; \\
x := y; x + y; x / y; \\
1600; 900.}

\plush{}

This is what "\texttt{L x1, y1, x2, y2}" means:

\begin{multicols}{2}
{\ttfamily
dx := x2 - x1;\\
dx := dx / 1600;\\
dy := y2 - y1;\\
dy := dy / 900;\\
LOOP;\\
DRAW x1, y1;\\
IF x1 > x2 THEN BREAK;\\
IF y1 > y2 THEN BREAK;\\
x1 := x1 + dx;\\
y1 := y1 + dy;\\
END LOOP;}
\par\columnbreak\par
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3,line width=4pt]
\path[draw] (.5, .7) -- (2.5, 1.8);
\node[anchor=north] at (.5, .7) {\texttt{(x1, y1)}};
\node[anchor=south] at (2.5, 1.9) {\texttt{(x2, y2)}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{multicols}
